To compile this software you need:
    - a C99 compiler (gcc, clang)
    - the GLFW library installed on your system
    - the lua library installed on your system
    - GNU make installed on your system

If all the requirements are met, you can then use GNU make to build the software by just running the `make` command.
The resulting binaries can be found in the `bin` folder.

NOTE: the game must be run in a directory that contains also the `assets` directory or the necessary files will not be found!
